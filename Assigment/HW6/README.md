# Assigment 06 -16 Feb - Code Autocompletion

1. Find a dataset about Python(or similar; not too big) - you guys can search code parrot by hugging face....(https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-jupyter-code-to-text) they have dataset for python - donâ€™t take everything - it will be too big.

2. Train it!!  It will take around 10 hours to train.....

3. Then build a website, make a very stupid code editor that can suggest a list of potential next code....and you can select them.

## Demo Web
#### 
This is the result after I trained the LSTM model for more than 10 hours and displayed the results for the local website I built.
