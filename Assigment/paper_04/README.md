| Question Reserch    | How to generate prompts automatically to elicit knowledge from language models and use the generated knowledge to improve downstream tasks |
| Related Work |  - Prompt Engineering: The paper builds upon the concept of prompt engineering, which involves designing high-quality prompts to improve the performance of language models on specific tasks. Prompt engineering has been used in various natural language processing applications, such as question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis. <br /> Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning: The paper also relates to recent work on few-shot and zero-shot learning, which aims to train models on a small number of examples or no examples at all, respectively. This line of research has gained significant attention due to its potential to reduce the need for large amounts of annotated data. <br /> Fine-Tuning of Language Models: The paper also relates to previous work on fine-tuning language models, which involves re-training a pre-trained language model on a specific task using a small amount of task-specific data. Fine-tuning has been shown to be an effective approach for improving the performance of language models on a wide range of tasks, including text classification, language generation, and question answering.|
| Solution     | The paper proposes a method called AUTOPROMPT that automatically generates prompts to elicit knowledge from language models. AUTOPROMPT uses a two-stage process:  <br />  It generates a set of prompts using an iterative algorithm that maximizes the expected quality of the generated prompts. <br /> - It fine-tunes the language model on the generated prompts and uses the resulting model to improve downstream tasks.  |
| Method       | The method involves several steps: <br /> 1. The algorithm generates a set of candidate prompts by sampling from a set of template prompts. <br /> 2. Each candidate prompt is scored by the language model based on the likelihood of the prompt given the context. <br /> 3. The algorithm selects the highest scoring prompts and generates new prompts by modifying the selected prompts using different heuristics. <br /> 4. The process continues until a fixed number of prompts are generated. <br /> 5. The language model is fine-tuned on the generated prompts, and the resulting model is used to improve downstream tasks. |
| Result       | The paper demonstrates that AUTOPROMPT outperforms several baseline methods in a range of tasks, including text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. The experiments show that AUTOPROMPT generates prompts that are more effective in eliciting knowledge from the language model and improving downstream tasks. The paper also shows that AUTOPROMPT can be used to perform zero-shot and few-shot learning, where the model is trained on a small number of examples. |
