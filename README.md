| Topic        |                 Analyzing Wrap-Up Effects through an Information-Theoretic Lens                                             |

| Question Reserch    | - Data measured on words at the end of a sentence is often omitted. Consequently, the understanding of the cognitive processes that might be involved in these wrap-up effects is limited. <br /> - Are word and context surprisals that matter in real time (RT) data analysis? |
| Related Work | - Studies analyzing reading times have been employed to explore a number of psycholinguistic theories.<br /> - The existence of wrap-up effects is well-known the cognitive processes giving rise to them are still not fully understood.<br /> - Most studies of online processing omit data from these words to explicitly control for the confounding factors wrap-up effects introduce.<br /> - The few studies on wrap-up effects rely on smalldatasets, none of which analyze naturalistic text.<br /> - The long line of work that has connected information-theoretic measures and psychometric data employing similar methods to build models of sentence- and clause-final RTs. |
| Solution     | The author attempts to learn more about these processes by examining the relationship between enveloping effects and information theory quantities, such as word and context surprisals. |
| Method       | Build models of sentence- and clause-final RTs.|
| Result       | - The author find that operationalizations of the information contained in preceding context lead to better predictions of these RTs, while not adding significant predictive power for sentence-medial RTs.<br /> - Provide evidence (either in support or against) about several theories of the nature of wrap-up processes. |
