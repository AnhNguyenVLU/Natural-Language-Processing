| Question Reserch    | - A skewed distribution of RTs is skewed by what words? <br /> - Are word and context surprisals that matter in real time (RT) data analysis? |
| Related Work | - Studies analyzing reading times have been employed to explore a number of psycholinguistic theories.<br /> - The existence of wrap-up effects is well-known the cognitive processes giving rise to them are still not fully understood.<br /> - Most studies of online processing omit data from these words to explicitly control for the confounding factors wrap-up effects introduce.<br /> - The few studies on wrap-up effects rely on smalldatasets, none of which analyze naturalistic text.<br /> - The long line of work that has connected information-theoretic measures and psychometric data employing similar methods to build models of sentence- and clause-final RTs. |
